# Neuron-Model
To compile the executable run `make test` in the `cpp_code` directory \
To compile the Neuron Model Exectuable run `make neuronmodel` in the `cpp_code` directory  \
To run the python code run `python graph_test.py` in the `python_code` directory. The resulting graph will be in the `graphs` directory
 To remove all the png graphs generated run `make clean_img` in the `cpp_code` directory
 To regenerate all the ong graphs first run `bash to_python_script` in the `python_code` directory, then run `python graph_test.py`
